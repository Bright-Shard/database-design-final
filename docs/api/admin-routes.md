This document describes the internal API endpoints for NormFlix. Most of these endpoints use similar API routes to the customer routes for simplicity. However, they require using a bearer token for a NormFlix account; normal users cannot use these APIs.





# `/accounts/*` Endpoints

These endpoints are for account management.
